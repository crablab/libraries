#Libraries
This is a selection of libraries I have used and is primarily *aide memoir* to myself! 

##JavaScript
 * http://fusejs.io/ - Filters out users search queries, no matter what the SPAG
 * https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/ - Dropdown predictive search

## HTML5
 * https://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/ Non-JS predictive search (at most basic)
